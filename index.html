            <h3>STRANGE PANDEMIC AFFECTING THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
            <p>
              After months of a long tough lockdown with people having hope that the strange covid-19 pandemic was coming to an end, 
a rapid increase in the number of confirmined cases surpassing the 1 million mark and the active cases started to increase more than ever before putting the country at risk. 

The South African economy has been suffering to recover fully and to add more jobs following many job losses earlier this year but the pandemic disturbed all of that from happening.
<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa had to consult and discuss the state of the pandemic in the country whereby that led to making a decision to place the country back to lockdown level 3.

Despite the negative economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic to the country ,lockdown restrictions had to be tightened in such a way to curb the spread of the virus.

The sale of alcohol has been banned and the operating time of many businesses was reduced which means all of those businesses will struggle financially.</p>

The first wave of the covid-19 has had a huge impact on the economic growth which has led to high unemployment numbers and interest rates cut whilst the economy was trying to recover from the collapse earlier this year.

Now the country is facing a second wave whereby the new strain of the virus is spreading very faster than before.

The second wave is imposing a high threat to the future economic outlook of south africa.

The concerns that the country will have to get deeper in debt to make vaccines available ,aswell as to help the poorest people of this country to thrive during the strict lockdown regulations and assistance with business rescue plans to collapsing businesses in the country is very costy.


<p>The south african economy is shrinking with the pandemic getting worse daily and all of this create demand and supply shocks in the markets.

Many South Africans are now unemployed and relaying on the unemployment benefit schemes to overcome the challenges brought by the strange Covid-19 pandemic.

Our fellow South Africans are now forced to stay indoors to battle the spread of this pandemic and it has never been easy for them especially fact that many of them are unemployed they are always outside hustling money to feed their families. 

However grace shall rescue the South African nation with hope and faith everything will come to ease.</p>
